// 5. PriorityQueue Example: Task Scheduling
/*
 Properties of PriorityQueue

1. Ordered Collection: Elements are ordered based on their natural ordering or 
by a specified comparator.

2. Heap Implementation: Internally implemented as a binary heap, allowing 
efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element.

3. Dynamic Size:Automatically resizes as elements are added or removed.

4. Non-Synchronized: Not thread-safe; requires external synchronization for 
concurrent access.

5. Null Elements: Does not allow null elements; adding null throws a 
NullPointerException.

5. Duplicates Allowed:Can contain multiple occurrences of the same element.

6. Accessing Elements: The head of the queue (highest priority element) can be 
accessed using the peek() method.

7. Removal of Elements: The highest priority element can be removed using the 
poll() method.

8. Comparator Support: Can be constructed with a custom comparator to define 
the order of elements.

9. Iterators: Provides an iterator, but the order of iteration is not 
guaranteed to match the priority order.

10. Performance: Insertion and removal operations have a time complexity of 
O(log n); accessing the head element is O(1).

11. Not a Blocking Queue: Does not block on operations; it is a non-blocking 
queue.
